# MDP-AI
This is a final project in AI course.
The project is mainly about building a "Who wants to be a millionaire" game with model suggestions every time the user finishes a level.
In other words, after the user answers a quesiton right (wins this level), the model suggests him whether to continue to next level or to quit.
The suggestion is done on given probabilities to win each level and the amount of money the user will be rewarded at that level.
Is it worth it to risk and take the next level? (If we answer wrong on the next, level we loose everything). or quit now and have fun with the rewards we already had.
